          This course covers computer programming in one of its most basic forms and introduces computer architecture.
          The understanding and appreciation of assembly language is the foundation for the understanding
          of the digital computer and its programming. Assembly language is just one step removed from machine language,
          the language directly understood by the CPU. This course will cover: computer architecture,
          data representation, instruction sets, addressing modes, assembly language programming techniques,
          interrupts and exceptions, assemblers, peripheral programming and the relationship
          between assembly language and high-level languages.
